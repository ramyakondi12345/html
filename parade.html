    <h3>13 Intresting facts about the parade of 26th January</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>As we all know every year, the organisation of the parade on 26th January is done at Rajpath 
        situated in New Delhi, but do you know that Rajpath was not the organizing centre for the parade 
        from 1950 to 1954? During these years, the 26th January parade was held at Irwin Stadium 
        (now National Stadium), Kingsway, Red Fort, and Ramleela Maidan respectively.<br>
    Rajpath became the permanent venue for the parade of 26th January in AD 1955. Rajpath
     was known by the name ‘Kingsway’ at that time, now known as Kartavyapath.</li>
    <li>Every year, the Prime Minister/ President/ or the ruler of any nation is invited as a guest for the 26th 
    January parade. The first parade was held on 26th January 1950, President of Indonesia Dr. Sukarno was 
    invited as a guest. However, in 1955 when the first parade was held at Rajpath, The Governor-General of
     Pakistan Malik Ghulam Mohammad was invited.</li>
    <li>The parade event on 26th January begins with the arrival of the President. First of all, the cavalie
     bodyguards of the President salute the National Flag, and during this time, the National Anthem is 
     played and the 21 Guns Salute is also given. But do you know that firing is not done with 21 canons? 
     Instead, 7- cannons of the Indian army, which are known as “25- Ponders” are used for firing in 3 rounds.</li>
   <li> All the participants of the parade get ready by 2 AM and arrive at the Rajpath by 3 AM. But the
     preparations for the parade begin in July of the previous year when all the participants are formally 
     informed about their participation. Till August, they practice parade at their related regiment
      centers and reach Delhi by December. The participants have already practiced for 600 hours before
       performing on the 26th of January formally.</li>
   <li> A special camp near the premises of the India Gate is organized for all the Tanks, Armored Vehicles, 
    and modern equipment showing the military power of India. The investigation process for each Cannon 
    and the work of whitewashing is performed in 10 stages mostly but this time maybe it will be different.</li>
   <li>For rehearsal for the parade of 26th January, each group covers the distance of 12 Kilometres but on
     the day of 26th January, they cover the distance of 9 Kilometres only. Judges are seated all through 
     the way of the parade, and judge every participating group based on 200 parameters, and based on this
      judgment, the “best marching group” title is awarded.</li>
